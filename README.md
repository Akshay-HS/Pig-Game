# Pig Game

The Pig Game is an interactive and entertaining two-player dice game that consists of two main parts: the Login Page and the Pig Game itself.

2. **Continue:** After entering the names, clicking the "Continue" button will take you to the main Pig Game.

## Pig Game

The Pig Game is the core part of the project, where players compete to reach a predefined score by rolling dice and managing their points. It features a user-friendly interface with player information, current scores, dice rolling, and more.

### How to Play

1. **Roll the Dice:** Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to accumulate points. Be cautious not to roll a 1, which resets your turn and causes you to lose your accumulated points.

2. **Hold Points:** At any time during your turn, you can choose to "Hold" to save your current turn's points and switch to the other player.

3. **Winning the Game:** The objective is to be the first player to reach or exceed the specified winning score, typically 100 points.

### Features

- **Customizable Winning Score:** Players can set the winning score to their preferred value.
- **Two-Player Mode:** Play against a friend and take turns to reach the winning score.
